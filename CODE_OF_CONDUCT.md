Code of Conduct
===============

Our Standards
-------------

Open, kind, and inquisitive

This is the norm for this little corner of the world. Due to the complications of cross-cultural
communication, empathy and consideration are encouraged. Harassment in any form is not tolerated.

Please feel welcome, whoever you are!


Reporting Guidelines
--------------------

While we should all be respectful, sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of how they
come across (especially across cultures). When that happens, please reach out in a respectful way.

Assume good faith; bad behaviour is more likely someone due to being unaware than intent. Should
there be difficulties in dealing with the situation, please reach out in confidence to
[the maintainer](mailto:from_github@westravanholthe.nl).
