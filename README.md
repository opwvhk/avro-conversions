Avro Conversions
================

Provides parsers to read various formats as Avro records (currently JSON and XML), as well as tools
to manipulate and/or describe schemas. The latter includes the conversion of XML Schema definitions
(XSD) and JSON Schema into Avro schemas.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is split into two parts. The impatient among us can start with the "Quickstart"
section below. For the others, there is [more elaborate documentation](doc/index.md).


Quickstart
----------

Want to jump right in? Here's a simple example to read a JSON schema, manipulate in into an Avro
schema, and then parse a JSON file into the (different) Avro records:

```java
import opwvhk.avro.SchemaManipulator;
import opwvhk.avro.json.JsonAsAvroParser;
import opwvhk.avro.util.NamingConvention;
import org.apache.avro.Schema;
import org.apache.avro.generic.GenericRecord;

class Example {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		// Expected are 2 arguments:
		// * the location of a JSON schema file
		// * the location of a JSON file
		URL jsonSchemaLocation = new URL(args[0]);
		URL jsonFileLocation = new URL(args[1]);

		StringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder();
		// Read an Avro schema; other methods can convert an XSD or JSON schema.
		Schema readSchema = SchemaManipulator.startFromJsonSchema(jsonSchemaLocation)
				.useSchemaNamingConvention(NamingConvention.PASCAL_CASE)
				.useFieldNamingConvention(NamingConvention.CAMEL_CASE)
				.renameField("newName", "path", "to", "field")
				.renameSchema("OldName", "NewName")
				.alsoDocumentAsMarkdownTable(buffer)
				.finish();
		// Print the schema as a Markdown table
		System.out.println(buffer);

		// Create a parser that reads JSON, validated according to the JSON schema, into Avro
		// records using a read schema.
		GenericData model = GenericData.get();
		JsonAsAvroParser parser = new JsonAsAvroParser(jsonSchemaLocation, readSchema, model);

		// The record type depends on the class generated by GenericData.get() (you can also use SpecificData or ReflectiveData).
		GenericRecord record = parser.parse(jsonFileLocation);
		System.out.println(record);
	}
}
```

Upgrade notes
-------------

### From 1.3 to 2.0

1. XML validation has been changed. Now, parsing will either always or never validate, depending on
   how the parser was created. See the constructor parameters for details.
2. Constructing a JSON parser can no longer throw a (library specific) `GenerationException`; this
   has become a runtime exception instead.
